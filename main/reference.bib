It was found that exposure of a GaAs photocathode to N2, H2 and CH4 does not affect the QE, whereas exposure to O2, CO2 and CO leads to a substantial reduction in photocathode QE. It was also found that the QE of photocathodes which have been degraded under O2 exposure can be recovered to 95\% of their initial QE level by the re-caesiation process, while those which have been degraded under exposure to CO and CO2 can only be partly restored to 60\textendash 70\% of their initial QE levels.},

It is also applicable to generate short electron bunch down to 100 fs with a bunch compression. Ultra-short photon pulse can be generated by the inverse laser Compton scattering or FEL with the short pulse from ERL. In ERL, one of the most critical device is the electron gun. The electron beam is generated by GaAs photo-cathode driven by a high-average power laser. Enough quantum efficiency and a reasonably long operational lifetime are required. The Negative Electron Affinity (NEA) surface, which is generated by artificial treatments on GaAs crystal, has an important roll to generate the high brightness electron beam. In a real operation, 15 W laser is illuminated on the GaAs cathode in a small spot size (typically a few mm) and the cathode temperature is increased by this drive laser. The operational lifetime of GaAs cathode is an important issue in such tough condition. In this article, we examine GaAs lifetime as a function of temperature to evaluate effects of heating. In our estimation, temperature rise is 60 K for 5 mm laser radius. We observed a significant degradation of the lifetime by heating. By analyzing the lifetime as desorption process, the binding energy of ``NEA molecule'' on the GaAs surface is found to be 1.20 eV. According to the result, the lifetime degradation by heating is one of the most critical problem on the ERL gun and should be solved to develop a robust cathode, otherwise we should consider an active cooling of the cathode.},

The electron affinity of cesium telluride thin film was found to increase with time after fabrication. An increase of the affinity resulted in deterioration of a quantum efficiency under laser light exposure with constant wavelength. The surface of photocathode in RF gun can suffer enormous damage easily at the conditioning process of RF gun before electron extraction. A method to refresh the photocathode surface after RF conditioning has been required. A photodetachment process is a candidate to refresh aged/damaged photocathode with X-ray exposure. A recovery of quantum efficiency for the aged photocathode film by this refreshing process is shown.},

NEA-GaAs photo-cathode is a unique technology which is capable for generating highly polarized and extremely low emittance beam. Quantum efficiency (QE) of the cathode is high in near IR region, so it is favor to generate a high current density beam. These advantages are originated to the Negative Electron Affinity (NEA) surface, but it is fragile so the operational lifetime is limited. A study on a robust NEA surface cathode is reported. According to the hetero-junction model, Cs-Te thin film deposited on GaAs forms a robust NEA surface. We performed the Cs-Te evaporation experiment on a clean GaAs cathode and measured QE spectra. We found that some sample showed a high quantum efficiency up to 900nm wavelength which strongly suggested a NEA surface formation.},

These advantages are due to NEA (Negative Electron Affinity) surface where the conduction band minimum is higher than the vacuum energy state. The NEA surface is artificially made with Cs-O/F evaporation on the cleaned GaAs surface, but the NEA surface is fragile, so that the emission is easily lost by poor vacuum environment and high emission density. NEA activation with any vital material is desirable. We found that the GaAs can be activated by CsTe thin film which is known as a vital photo-cathode material. The photo-electron emission spectrum extends up to 900 nm wavelength which corresponds to the band-gap energy of GaAs. The result strongly suggests that the surface becomes effectively NEA state by the CsTe thin film.},

A typical activated GaAssurface is found to consist of both a layer of oxygen bonded to GaAs and a (Cs+,O− 2) layer. The GaAs‐O layer was not anticipated prior to this work. A GaAs‐O‐Cs dipole plus the polarization of a Cs+‐O− 2‐Cs+ sandwich layer is proposed to explain the NEA condition based on the structure of activated surfaces found in this work. The identification of the O‐GaAs bonding layer explains the better yield achieved by the two‐step activation process compared to that achieved by a single‐step process. Possible optimization of the activation process by forming the O‐GaAs layer and the (Cs+,O− 2) layer is also discussed. Adsorption of OH from the residual gas in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber is identified as one degradation mechanism of the GaAsphotocathodes.},

	abstract = {To enable the use of GaAs-based devices as chemical sensors, their surfaces must be chemically modified. Reproducible adsorption of molecules in the liquid phase on the GaAs surfaces requires controlled etching procedures. Several analytical methods were applied, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS) in attenuated total reflection and multiple internal reflection mode (ATR/MIR), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the analysis of GaAs (100) samples treated with different wet-etching procedures. The assignment of the different features due to surface oxides present in the vibrational and XPS spectra was made by comparison with those of powdered oxides (Ga2O3, As2O3 and As2O5). The etching procedures here described, namely, those using low concentration HF solutions, substantially decrease the amount of arsenic oxides and aliphatic contaminants present in the GaAs (100) surfaces and completely remove gallium oxides. The mean thickness of the surface oxide layer drops from 1.6 nm in the raw sample to 0.1 nm after etching. However, in presence of light, water dissolution of arsenic oxides is enhanced, and oxidized species of gallium cover the surface. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {To obtain cleaner GaAs photocathode surface, various wet chemical cleaning methods to remove the oxides and carbon contaminations from the surface of GaAs photocathode are investigated, and an improved chemical etching method is presented to further enhance the cathode photoemission performance. By means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, characteristics of these methods are summarized. HF solution can effectively reduce surface oxides, but it does not effectively act on the absorbed carbon contaminations. The mixed solution of HCl and isopropanol scores well in removing carbon contaminations, but the ability of removing oxides is relatively weaker. The mixed solution of HCl and deionized water right after the mixed solution of H2SO4, H2O2 and deionized water is unfavorable to reduce Ga oxides. The improved chemical etching method, which uses HF solution followed by the mixture of HCl and isopropanol has more advantages in removing oxides and carbon contaminations at the same time. Moreover, a hydrophobic surface is obtained by using the improved method, which also plays a role in the contaminations removal. The quantum efficiencies of GaAs photocathode undergoing various wet chemical cleaning procedures are compared after subsequent heat treatment and activation. The results show that the chemical treatment of HF solution followed by the mixture of HCl and isopropanol can help GaAs photocathode obtain higher activated photocurrent and quantum efficiency.},

@article{vergara1999,
	abstract = {In this paper we present a model whose purpose was to study the electron energy distribution curves (EDC) of high efficiency negative electron affinity (NEA) GaAs photocathodes and to explain the features of earlier experimental data. The EDCs were calculated for transmission mode cathodes using the Monte Carlo method. The influence of parameters such as the surface potential barrier shape, p-doping concentration, vacuum level (VL), and temperature on the EDC broadening was studied. Using our model, we found that the experimental electron energy spread could be explained by the extra time the electrons spend inside the semiconductor due to multiple bouncing at the surface before escaping. There is no need to invoke electron interaction with surface trapping states. The difference between the effective electron mass in the semiconductor and the mass in the vacuum causes a refraction effect that narrows the escape angle around the surface normal. In accordance with the dipole model for NEA, the surface barrier was modeled in two sections: a triangular barrier at the surface and a flat plateau outside the semiconductor at the vacuum level. The magnitude of the energy distribution width of the experimental data studied indicates that the electrons spend a long time in the band bending region before escaping, which in turn indicates that the electrons are quantum reflected at the surface barrier a number of times before their final escape. This barrier is very sensitive to surface preparation details. The experimental data indicates that, for the high yield cathode considered, the vacuum level lies approx. 0.1 eV below the bulk conduction band minimum and that the modeled triangular potential at the surface barrier was approximately 1.5 angstrom thick and 4 eV high. In the case of this barrier, the escape probability for electrons hitting the surface with energy between the vacuum level and 0.2 eV above was smaller than 0.2.},

The emission current sensitively depends on work function change and its dependence allows us to determine that the shape of the vacuum barrier was close to double triangular. Regarding the NEA surface degradation during photoemission, we discuss the importance of residual gas components the oxygen and hydrogen. We also found that gentle annealing (≤100°C) of aged photocathodes results in a lower work function and may offer a patch to reverse the performance degradation.},

	abstract = {Ga1-xInxAs alloys in the composition range 0≤x≥0.52 and band-gap (Eg) range of 1.38 to 0.74 eV were activated with Cs and O2. Samples of different carrier concentrations were investigated. For band gaps down to about 0.8 eV, the photothreshold was equal to the band gap. The longest wavelength threshold determined was 1.58 $\mu$m. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the longest wavelength response yet achieved for photoemission into vacuum from a III-V compound. The surface escape probability, B, was derived from the quantum yield data for each sample. The B-vs-Eg data were analyzed according to a surface escape model which includes the effects of (i) a finite-width initial energy distribution of photoexcited carriers, (ii) the bent-band region and (iii) various types of surface potential barriers. Surface escape probability data pertaining to a single doping density could be explained by a model that includes only a work-function barrier or simple step potential. However, in order to explain the data for the several doping concentrations in a consistent manner, it was necessary to include an electron-semitransparent energy barrier above the vacuum level. A barrier width of 8 {\AA} gives good agreement with the experimental data. This dimension is consistent with the thickness of the CsSingle Bond signO activation layer which was experimentally determined to be on the order of a monolayer. These results are interpreted in terms of a surface double-dipole model. {\textcopyright} 1972 The American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {A detailed picture of the behavior of cesium oxide as a low work-function coating on III-V semiconductors and on silver has been obtained. Measurement of required cesium and oxygen exposure for optimum photoyield shows that the compound normally formed is close to CS2O, with variations in required exposure for very thin and very thick layers. By making simultaneous Kelvin work-function, photoyield-threshold, and thickness measurements, it was possible to establish that the CS2O, an n-type semiconductor, forms a heterojunction or Schottky barrier with its substrate. This provides a band bending which produces a gradual lowering of the vacuum level with increasing thickness to an ultimate work function of 0.6 eV. The photoyield and dark current from the substrate are limited by the interfacial barrier at the heterojunction. This barrier is 1.00±0.05 eV for a silver substrate and 1.23±0.03 eV for GaSb. The band-bending distance in the CS2O is about 50 {\AA} and the hot electron scattering distance is 9 {\AA}. These data have been used in an improved calculation of the maximum $\Gamma$ escape probability and requisite CS2O thickness for electron emission from III-V semiconductors of different bandgaps. Electron emission from C S2O induced by an oxygen overpressure was also measured. C SOH is compared with CS2O as a work-function lowering coating. {\textcopyright} 1970 The American Institute of Physics.},

To do this, the photocathode was activated far beyond the normal maximum of quantum efficiency, and several photocathode parameters were measured periodically during this process. In doing so, the data obtained enabled us to determine the domains of validity for the DL- and HJ-models, to define more precisely the characteristic parameters of the photocathode within both of these domains and thus to reveal the peculiarities of the influence of the (Cs,O)-layer on the photoelectron escape probability.},

We describe a recently commissioned system for prequalifying and studying photocathodes for CEBAF with a load-locked, low-voltage polarized electron source coupled to a compact retarding-field Mott polarimeter. The polarimeter uses simplified electrode structures and operates from 5 to 30kV. The effective Sherman function for this device has been calibrated by comparison with the CEBAF 5 MeV Mott polarimeter. For elastic scattering from a thick gold target at 20keV, the effective Sherman function is 0.201(5). Its maximum efficiency at 20keV, defined as the detected count rate divided by the incident particle current, is 5.4(2) × 10-4, yielding a figure-of-merit, or analyzing power squared times efficiency, of 1.0(1) × 10-5. The operating parameters of this new polarimeter design are compared to previously published data for other compact Mott polarimeters of the retarding-field type. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},
