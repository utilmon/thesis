  abstract      = {A large, world-wide community of physicists is working to realise an exceptional physics program of energy-frontier, electron-positron collisions with the International Linear Collider (ILC). This program will begin with a central focus on high-precision and model-independent measurements of the Higgs boson couplings. This method of searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model is orthogonal to and complements the LHC physics program. The ILC at 250 GeV will also search for direct new physics in exotic Higgs decays and in pair-production of weakly interacting particles. Polarised electron and positron beams add unique opportunities to the physics reach. The ILC can be upgraded to higher energy, enabling precision studies of the top quark and measurement of the top Yukawa coupling and the Higgs self-coupling.},

The pre-injector design includes the polarized electron source, bunching section, traveling wave plate (TWP) LINAC, zigzag phase space manipulation and a spin rotator. In this proceeding, we discuss the RF frequency selection, and achieving energy spread as low as 0.25\% by longitudinal phase space manipulation.

In this work, experiments were performed to quantify the improvement in photocathode charge lifetime by biasing the photo-gun anode with a positive voltage, which repels ions generated downstream of the anode. The photocathode charge lifetime improved by almost a factor of two when the anode was biased compared to the usual grounded configuration. Simulations were performed using the particle tracking code General Particle Tracer (GPT) with a new custom element. The simulation results showed that both the number and energy of ions play a role in the pattern of QE degradation. The experiment results and conclusions supported by GPT simulations will be presented.},

  abstract = {GaAs photocathodes are the primary choice for generating spin-polarized electron beam with high brightness, high polarization, and fast polarization reversal. However, it suffers from short lifetime due to the highly reactive nature of the emission surface, resulting in substantial operational difficulties. Activating GaAs with a more robust material, such as Cs2Te, shows comparable polarization to that of Cs\textendash O activation and increases the lifetime due to the robustness of the Cs2Te layer. However, previously reported photocathodes based on Cs\textendash Te activation on GaAs suffer from 10\texttimes{} lower quantum efficiency (QE) compared to that activated with conventional Cs\textendash O activation. Herein, we report activation recipes for GaAs photocathodes using Cs, O2, and Te. For Cs\textendash Te activation, the QE was 6.6\% at 532 nm. For Cs\textendash O\textendash Te activation, the QE was 8.8\% at 532 nm and 4.5\% at 780 nm. The negative electron affinity of the activated GaAs was directly measured and confirmed by low energy electron microscopy. We also report the activation layer chemical states and stoichiometry using in situ micro-spot synchrotron radiation x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Negative Electron Affinity (NEA) GaAs cathode is an unique device which can generate a highly polarized electron beam with circularly polarized light. The NEA surface is conventionally made by Cs and O/NF3 adsorption on the cleaned p-doped GaAs crystal, but the robustness of the cathode is very limited, so that the electron emission is easily lost by residual gas adsorption, ion back-bombardment, etc. To improve the cathode robustness, NEA activation with a stable thin-film on GaAs surface according to Hetero junction hypothesis has been proposed by the author. An experiment of the NEA activation with CsKTe thin film was carried out at Hiroshima University and a significant electron emission with 1.43 eV photon was observed which strongly suggested NEA activation. The cathode showed 16 to 20 times improvement of lifetime comparing to GaAs activated with Cs and O.},

  abstract = {GaAs is the choice of photocathode material for polarized electron sources. The well established method of activating GaAs for beam extraction is to use Cs and Oxygen to create a 'Negative Electron Affinity'(NEA) layer. However, this layer is highly sensitive to vacuum and gets damaged due to ion back bombardment in DC guns. In this work, we explore activation methods that used Tellurium in conjunction with the usual Cs and Oxygen. We report our method to activate GaAs and show charge lifetime results for our activation method. Our results show that the use of Te could potentially help with longer charge lifetimes from GaAs cathodes in DC guns.},

  abstract = {High-performance photocathodes for many prominent particle accelerator applications, such as x-ray free-electron lasers, cannot be grown in situ. These highly reactive materials must be grown and then transported to the electron gun in an ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) suitcase, during which time monolayer-level oxidation is unavoidable. Thin film Cs3Sb photocathodes were grown on a variety of substrates. Their performance and chemical state were measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after transport in a UHV suitcase as well as after O2-induced oxidation. The unusual chemistry of cesium oxides enabled trace amounts of oxygen to drive structural reorganization at the photocathode surface. This reorganization pulled cesium from the bulk photocathode, leading to the development of a structurally complex and O2-exposure-dependent cesium oxide layer. This oxidation-induced phase segregation led to downward band bending of at least 0.36 eV as measured from shifts in the Cs 3d5/2 binding energy. At low O2 exposures, the surface developed a low work function cesium suboxide overlayer that had little effect on quantum efficiency (QE). At somewhat higher O2 exposures, the overlayer transformed to Cs2O; no antimony or antimony oxides were observed in the near-surface region. The development of this overlayer was accompanied by a 1000-fold decrease in QE, which effectively destroyed the photocathode via the formation of a tunnel barrier. The O2 exposures necessary for degradation were quantified. As little as 100 L of O2 irreversibly damaged the photocathode. These observations are discussed in the context of the rich chemistry of alkali oxides, along with potential material strategies for photocathode improvement.},

  abstract = {In high current DC gun, GaAs photocathode lifetime is limited by the ion back-bombardment. While gun operation ions are generated due to the impact of electrons with residual gas molecules. These ions accelerate back towards the cathode and remove the activation layer's material from the photocathode surface, thus causing the photoemission performance degradation. We have developed an object-oriented code to simulate the ion generation due to dynamic gas pressure and ion trace in the electromagnetic field. The pressure profile varies from cathode position towards the transfer line behind the anode, which signifies the importance of dynamic simulation for ion back-bombardment study. In our surface damage study, we traced the energy and position of the ions on the photocathode surface and performed the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter(SRIM) simulation to count the number of Cesium atoms removed from the surface due to single impact. Cesium atom removal is directly related to the photocathode Quantum Efficiency(QE) decay. Our new dynamic simulation code can be used in any DC gun to study ion back-bombardment. We have used this new code to better understand the ion generation in prototype BNL HVDC gun, and we also estimated the normalized QE decay due to ion back-bombardment.},
