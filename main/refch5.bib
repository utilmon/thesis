abstract = {Interferometric time-resolved two-photon photoemission is measured over an energy range of 0.5-3.2 eV and a temperature range of 33-300 K for cesiated low-index surfaces of copper. Reduction of the work function by alkali atom adsorption makes it possible to study the coherent and incoherent electron dynamics in energy regions where either intraband or interband excitation dominates. Since most of the energy of 3.08-eV photons is deposited in d-band holes, the creation of hot electrons through the Auger decay of d holes is an important mechanism for delayed production of secondary hot electrons. Slow electron-hole pair decoherence at the d-band maxima imply a d-hole lifetime of 24 +/- 3 fs at the top of the d bands. The contribution of Auger decay to the hot-electron production leads to non-exponential population dynamics for hot electrons below 1.5 eV, and a resolvable delayed rise below 0.65 eV. Surprisingly, the delayed secondary hot-electron production appears to be suppressed at low temperatures. The energy and temperature dependent contribution of the d-hole decay explains some aspects of the seemingly anomalous hot-electron lifetimes at the intensity maximum of the d-band two-photon photoemission.},

On the basis of the Sommerfeld theory and the Fermi-Dirac statistics, expressions are derived for the form of the energy distribution and current voltage curves in the vicinity of the apparent maximum energy. The method used is similar to that used by Fowler in computing the total emission current. In Part I the energies normal to the emitting surface are considered. At 0°K the theoretical current-voltage curve is a parabola tangent to the energy axis at Vmax, while for higher temperatures it approaches the axis asymptotically. In Part II the treatment is extended to the total energy of emission and in this case the current-voltage curve at 0°K is a parabola concave toward the voltage axis and cutting it at a large angle. At higher temperatures there is an asymptotic approach. Even at room temperature there is an uncertainty of several hundredths of a volt in Vmax, though the theory yields a method of determining the maximum energy which would be observed at 0°K. Both parts of the theory are found to be in agreement with new experiments on molybdenum. The bearing of the theory on the photoelectric determination of h is discussed.},

These conditions are characteristic of metal targets subjected to energetic ion bombardment or short-pulse laser irradiation. Computational analysis based on first-principles electronic structure calculations of the electron density of states predicts large deviations (up to an order of magnitude) from the commonly used approximations of linear temperature dependence of the electron heat capacity and a constant electron-phonon coupling. These thermophysical properties are found to be very sensitive to details of the electronic structure of the material. The strength of the electron-phonon coupling can either increase (Al, Au, Ag, Cu, and W), decrease (Ni and Pt), or exhibit nonmonotonic changes (Ti) with increasing electron temperature. The electron heat capacity can exhibit either positive (Au, Ag, Cu, and W) or negative (Ni and Pt) deviations from the linear temperature dependence. The large variations of the thermophysical properties, revealed in this work for the range of electron temperatures typically realized in femtosecond laser material processing applications, have important implications for quantitative computational analysis of ultrafast processes associated with laser interaction with metals.},

Recently, a scheme for producing such distributions, based on the strong longitudinal expansion of an initially very short beam under its own space-charge forces, has been proposed. In this Letter we present the experimental demonstration of this scheme, obtained by illuminating the cathode in a rf photogun with an ultrashort laser pulse (approximately 35 fs rms) with an appropriate transverse profile. The resulting 4 MeV beam spatiotemporal (x,t) distribution is imaged using a rf deflecting cavity with 50 fs resolution. A temporal asymmetry in the ellipsoidal profile, due to image charge effects at the photocathode, is observed at higher charge operation. This distortion is also found to degrade the transverse beam quality.},

The femtosecond photoemission yield from a copper cathode and the emittance of the created electron beams has been studied in a 12 MeV/m, 100 keV dc electron gun over a wide range of laser fluence, from the linear photoemission regime until the onset of image charge limitations and cathode damaging. The measured photoemission curves can be described well with available theory which includes the Schottky effect, second-order photoemission, and image charge limitation. The second-order photoemission can be explained by thermally assisted one-photon photoemission (1PPE) and by above-threshold two-photon photoemission (2PPE). Measurements with a fresh cathode suggest that the 2PPE process is dominant. The beam emittance has been measured for the entire range of initial surface charge densities as well. The emittance measurements of space-charge dominated beams can be described well by an envelope equation with generalized perveance. The dc gun produces 0.1 pC bunches with 25 nm rms normalized emittance, corresponding to a normalized brightness usually associated with rf photoguns. In this experimental study the limits of femtosecond photoemission from a copper cathode have been explored and analyzed in great detail, resulting in improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

abstract = {Electron beams in modern linear accelerators are now becoming limited in brightness by the intrinsic emittance of the photocathode electron source. Therefore it becomes important for large scale facilities such as free electron lasers to reduce this fundamental limit. In this Letter we present measurements of the intrinsic emittance for different laser wavelength (from 261 to 282 nm) and for different photocathode materials such as Mo, Nb, Al, Cu. Values as low as 0.41±0.03  mm{\textperiodcentered}mrad/mm laser spot size (rms) were measured for a copper photocathode illuminated with a 282 nm laser wavelength. The key element for emittance reduction is a uv laser system which allows adjustment of the laser photon energy to match the effective work function of the cathode material and to emit photoelectrons with a lower initial kinetic energy. The quantum efficiency over the explored wavelength range varies by less than a factor of 3.},

Furthermore, recent developments in material design and growth have resulted in photocathodes that can deliver high quantum efficiency and are sufficiently robust to use in high electric field gradient photoinjectors and free electron lasers. The growth process usually produces photoemissive material layers with rough surface profiles that lead to transverse accelerating fields and possible work function variations, resulting in emittance growth. To better understand the effects of temperature, density of states, and surface roughness on the properties of emitted electrons, we have developed realistic three-dimensional models for photocathode materials with grated surface structures. They include general modeling of electron excitation due to photon absorption, charge transport, and emission from flat and rough metallic surfaces. The...},

abstract = {Theoretical expressions are derived for the quantum yield and for the energy distribution of photoelectrons assuming bulk photoemission from a solid. The effects of electrons which escape without inelastic scattering after optical excitation, and of those electrons which escape after one inelastic-scattering event, are considered. The expressions relate optical transition probabilities, optical constants, and mean free paths for inelastic scattering in a solid to quantities which can be measured in photoemission experiments. Examples of photoemission data are interpreted to show how the contribution of once-scattered electrons can be separated from the contribution of those electrons which have not suffered an inelastic-scattering event before escaping. The contribution to photoemission of those electrons which have not been scattered is analyzed to show the way in which direct and nondirect optical transitions can be identified and the way in which the density of states in a solid can be determined. The contribution of once-scattered electrons to photoemission is analyzed to show the way in which the nature and strength of inelastic-scattering mechanisms can be determined. The effects of electron-electron scattering, scattering by plasmon creation, and the Auger process are described, and methods of obtaining mean free paths and other scattering parameters are suggested.},

In this paper we study the possibility of employing a radiofrequency photoinjector as the electron source for a time-resolved TEM.

Analysis and optimization of the system taking into account the achievable beam brightness, electron flux on the sample, chromatic and spherical aberration of the electron optic system, and space charge effects in image formation are presented and supported by detailed numerical modeling.

abstract = {Metal photocathodes are commonly used in high-field rf guns because they are robust, straightforward to implement, and tolerate relatively poor vacuum compared to semiconductor cathodes. However, these cathodes have low quantum efficiency (QE) even at UV wavelengths, and still require some form of cleaning after installation in the gun. A commonly used process for improving the QE is laser cleaning. In this technique the UV-drive laser is focused to a small diameter close to the metal's damage threshold and then moved across the surface to remove contaminants. This method does improve the QE, but can produce nonuniform emission and potentially damage the cathode. Ideally, an alternative process which produces an atomically clean, but unaltered, surface is needed. In this paper we explore using a hydrogen ion (H-ion) beam to clean a copper cathode. We describe QE measurements over the wavelength range of interest as a function of integrated exposure to an H-ion beam. We also describe the data analysis to obtain the work function and derive a formula of the QE for metal cathodes. Our measured work function for the cleaned sample is in good agreement with published values, and the theoretical QE as a function of photon wavelength is in excellent agreement with the cleaned copper experimental results. Finally, we propose an in situ installation of an H-ion gun compatible with existing s-band rf guns.},

Using the finite temperature-extended relations for the photocathode intrinsic emittance and quantum efficiency, the time-dependent emittance growth due to the same photoemission laser pulse is calculated. This laser heating is seen to limit the intrinsic emittance achievable for photoinjectors using short laser pulses and low quantum efficiency metal photocathodes. A pump-probe photocathode experiment in a standard 1.6 cell S-band gun is proposed, in which simulations show the time dependent thermal emittance modulation within the bunch from laser heating can persist for meters downstream and, in principle, be measured using a slice emittance diagnostic.},

abstract = {Irradiation of a metal with an ultrashort laser pulse leads to a disturbance of the free-electron gas out of thermal equilibrium. We investigate theoretically the transient evolution of the distribution function of the electron gas in a metal during and after irradiation with a subpicosecond laser pulse of moderate intensity.We consider absorption by inverse bremsstrahlung, electron-electron thermalization, and electron-phonon cou- pling. Each interaction process is described by a full Boltzmann collision integral without using any relaxation- time approach. Our model is free of phenomenological parameters.We solve numerically a system of time- and energy-dependent integro-differential equations. For the case of irradiation of aluminum, the results show the transient excitation and relaxation of the free-electron gas as well as the energy exchange between electrons and phonons. We find that laser absorption by free electrons in a metal is well described by a plasmalike absorption term. We obtain a good agreement of calculated absorption characteristics with values experimen- tally found. For laser excitations near damage threshold, we find that the energy exchange between electrons and lattice can be described with the two-temperature model, in spite of the nonequilibrium distribution function of the electron gas. In contrast, the nonequilibrium distribution leads at low excitations to a delayed cooling of the electron gas. The cooling time of laser-heated electron gas depends thus on excitation parameters and may be longer than the characteristic relaxation time of a Fermi-distributed electron gas depending on internal energy only. We propose a definition of the thermalization time as the time after which the collective behavior of laser-excited electrons equals the thermalized limit.},

abstract = {When an ultrashort laser pulse irradiates a metal, energy is absorbed by the electron system which is driven out of thermal equilibrium on a femtosecond time scale. Due to electron-electron collisions, a new thermodynamical equilibrium state within the electron system is established in a characteristic time, the so-called thermalization time. The absorbed energy of the electrons will be further transferred to the phononic system. The thermalization time as well as the electron-phonon coupling strength both strongly depend on the material properties and the excitation type. Furthermore, a nonthermalized electron gas couples differently to the phononic system as a thermalized one. In order to follow the relevant microscopic dynamics without the need to assume thermalized electrons, we apply complete Boltzmann collision integrals to describe the transient electron distribution due to excitation, thermalization, and relaxation. We implement the density of states of real materials in our approach. As a result of our simulations, we extract the electron thermalization time and the electron-phonon coupling under nonequilibrium conditions. Examples are given for aluminum, gold, and nickel.},
